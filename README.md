## Description

There are a lot of games out there, almost too many.

We've all been there, staring at some screen while endlessly scrolling through countless titles in the hopes that something will catch your interest. That's time lost that could be better spent gaming.

If you've ever faced a *paralysis of choice*, then **THE CATERED GAMER** could be your new best friend! Take the guesswork out and let random chaos reign supreme! The Catered Gamer app will discover three random games for you, based on your gaming platform and taste in games.


## Motivation

As a group of avid gamers, the team wanted a way to discover new and old games without having to sift through the endless tide of suggestions that one might receive from console tile lists, "best of" lists online and the like. Sometimes, one just wants a *shortlist* to choose from based on minor input, and this app is meant to provide that service.


In addition, the team looked to challenge themselves though the use of javaScript and jQuery, along with multiple API integrations, while keeping the codeblock concise. The biggest challenge on this project was the API integration - getting data to not only pull, but to randomize the results with every search, and to make results non-repeatable. 

## Usage

Once the page is loaded, select your desired PLATFORM and GENRE from the drop down menus, then click the SUBMIT button. *The Catered Gamer* will randomly pull three games from RAWG's files and present them for your review. Select ONE of those THREE from the pop-up card and you will be redirected to that particular game's main page, which contains a youTube video and details about the game.
